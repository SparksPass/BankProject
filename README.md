This project was made on the 24/12/2024, 
The program would ask for a username and password and would use input validation to ensure the passowrd was 8 characters,
The program would store the new account in a separate txt file.
The user would be able to enter their information and the program would check the txt file to ensure the username and password matched.
After the user had successfully logged in the user would be able to type a list of commands in the terminal:
(/help - Shows all command, /logout - Logs out of the account, /info - Shows account information, /deposit - Add money to account, /loan - Get a loan, /pay - Pay off loans, /transfer - Transfer money to another account).
When the user updates their account the progarm would access the .txt files and change the information to match the program.
